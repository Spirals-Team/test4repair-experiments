# Patch overfitting classification

Folder content

## core:

AstorPatchOverfitClassifier.py --> reads json data as classifies patches in A-B overfitting. Generates a file with the overfitted patches by bug id.

OverfittingJSON2Table.py --> Reads the summary file generated by AstorPatchOverfitClassifier.py and generates table with the patch classification.

parseTBetJSONFile --> Reads json file with BET information

## runners: executes scripts from core folder.

RunnerOverfitClassifier.py --> generates the summary file of patch overfitting classification using AstorPatchOverfitClassifier.py

Overfitting2Table.py --> reads the summary file generated by RunnerOverfitClassifier.py and creates a readme.md with the table that summarizes the pach classification

### test:

AstorPatchOverfitClassifierTest.py --> Testing overfitting classification

# Running Instructions:

To run scripts or test cases from this project, please follow these steps:

Requires Python 3.6

### Step 1

add project root folder to PYTHONPATH var:

```PYTHONPATH="<LOCATION>/test4repair-experiments/scripts/pythonScript:$PYTHONPATH";export PYTHONPATH;```

### Step 2

Go to folder where the script you want to run is located

```cd /<LOCATION>/test4repair-experiments/scripts/pythonScript/src/bet/runners```



### Step 3

Run scripts as tests:

Example running Overfitting2Table.py using unittest:

```/<PAth to python>/python3.6 -m unittest /Users/matias/develop/results/test4Repair/jsontest4repair/test4repair-experiments/scripts/pythonScript/src/bet/runners/Overfitting2Table.py```

Example using runner from PyCharm IDE (we explicitly indicate the cases to run):

```/<PAth to python>/python3.6 "/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/helpers/pycharm/pytestrunner.py" -p pytest_teamcity /<Location>/test4repair-experiments/scripts/pythonScript/src/bet/runners/Overfitting2Table.py "-k OverfittingClassification2Table and testCreateTableByPatch"```
